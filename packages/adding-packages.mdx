As we discussed earlier that Turborepo and pnpm workspaces handling the packages within our monitorEventLoopDelay, but if we cannot add any new packages, is it even any good?

So, lets learn how to automatically generate packages/apps in our monorepo.

There are two ways to add a package/app in a turborepo monorepo:

1. Automatic Generation
2. Manual Creation

## Automatic Generation

Turborepo has a very powerful tool to automatically generate new packages/apps based on any of your exisiting packages.

For example:

Suppose, we have to add an addition NextJS app called `admin`, for our admin panel.

We can just run 

```pnpm
turbo gen workspace --copy landing
```

This command will copy the `landing` NextJS app and the interactive CLI will let you choose what all packages to include and even to make this a package or an app.

<Note>You can specify the name of the app using the `--name` flag.</Note>

Learn more about code generation in the [Turborepo docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/code-generation).


## Manual Generation

<Warning>We encourage you to use the Turborepo code generator to automatically generate packages.</Warning>

Manual generation is nothing but just manually creating the apps or packages.

Please make sure that the name of the package/app is different in you package.json file and the path of that is added in the `pnpm-workspace.yaml`. 

<Note>By default, the file includes all the packages and apps in the `/apps` and `/packages` folder using a glob matcher.</Note>
