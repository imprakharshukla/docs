Rapid manages packages using **pnpm-workspaces** and **Turborepo**.

The structure of the monorepo is something like this:


- apps
    - backend
    - demo
    - landing

- packages
    - auth
    - db
    - ui

The packages/folders in the `packages` folder can we installed using pnpm like any package we install from the NPM repository.

```pnpm
pnpm install @repo/ui --filter landing
```

Landing is the name of one of our NextJS apps in the `/apps` folder.

<Note>Read more about pnpm package commands [here](https://pnpm.io/filtering).</Note>

The apps/folders in the `apps` folder represent the individual apps that we have in the monorepo.


## What are packages?

Packages contain the code that can be shared between the apps in the `/apps` folder by just installing them with pnpm.

Turborepo build dependencies makes using these packages super easy as you can add a build dependency of the package to the build/dev script of the app, so the packages are transpiled in real-time.

For example:

We share the TS-Rest contracts between apps i.e. the frontend and the backend.
For this we use a shared package `/packages/contract` which is installed in both all the apps that we want. Now we can import any code from these packages like we do for any other package installed by NPM.


## Branding

The packages have a `@repo` prefix by default, you can change that to anything that you like. For example `@rapid/db` etc.

To do this, just find and replace all instances of `@repo` to your desired name.



<Note>Adding a `@` is encouraged as it helps with scoped packages. [Learn More](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v10/using-npm/scope).</Note>
