Delete packages is not a complicated process. You can just simply delete the package from the file explorer or `rm -rf` ing the package. Just make sure:

1. No other package/app has that package as its dependency.
2. If you have explicity specified the package in the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file, please remove that as well.
