We have created a separate shared package called `/ui`, hence you can re-use the same components in every app without installing the library's component everytime for every app.

This approach makes it very clean to import the components.

### Comparison

Default import:

```typescript
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogContent,
  DialogDescription,
  DialogFooter,
  DialogHeader,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger,
} from "@/components/ui/dialog";
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input";
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label";
```

`/ui` import:

```typescript
import {
  Dialog,
  Button,
  DialogContent,
  DialogDescription,
  DialogFooter,
  DialogHeader,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger,
  Input,
  Label,
} from "@repo/ui";
```

## Adding new components

Since we take a different approach than the default, you will have to copy the components from the Shadcn/ui's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui) and paste it in the file and export it from the index.ts file.
