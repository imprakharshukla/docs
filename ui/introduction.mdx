Rapid provides [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) as the choice of component library.

Shadcn/UI has gotten extemely popular with over `57k github stars`.

Rapid makes using shadcn/ui easier as we have created a separate shared package called `/ui`, hence you can re-use the same components in every app without installing the library's component everytime for every app.


<Note>You can also create more shared UI components by creating and exporting them from the shared package.</Note>
